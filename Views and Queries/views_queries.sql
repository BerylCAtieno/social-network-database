PART 2(a): VIEW CREATION

The friendship relationship is stored as a directed relationship. To comfortably solve
queries regarding the friendship relationship, the relationships should be stored as
undirected. In this regard, you should create a view "pkp_symmetric" that contains
both directions.
*/

CREATE VIEW pkp_symmetric AS
SELECT personID_A AS personID_1, personID_B AS personID_2, creationDate
FROM person_knows_Person
UNION
SELECT personID_B AS personID_1, personID_A AS personID_2, creationDate
FROM person_knows_Person;
